You are lost in the woods.<br>
It is snowing and you are cold.<br>
In 14 turns you will die of exposure.

<h4>Initial project goals are as follows:</h4>
- Create an engine that takes input and returns output
- Write a scenario that presents multiple obstacles to the user
- Complete the adventure arc to allow for multiple endings
- Utilize ES6, strict mode, and HTML for engine
- When game is complete, use CSS and canvas tools to enrich the experience
